# Project details

## What is it

    User starts a session. Uses inputs their current task and the app will text or
    email them every 10 minutes to remind them what their current task is. Once
    finished with the task, user clears it and inputs their next task.\
    User can adjust reminder time.

## Minimal Viable Product
    
    The user can input their email or their phone number. They can start a session and
    be able to adjust reminder time and the reminder message sent. They can start a task
    and be reminded every 10 minutes of it until they mark it as completed. Stack of 
    completed tasks is displayed on page. 

## Nice to haves

    Users can create account to save phone number and email and archive past sessions.

## When will the project be compete?
